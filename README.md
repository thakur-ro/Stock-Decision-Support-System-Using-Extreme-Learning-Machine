### Extreme Learning Machine
Extreme Learning Machines are underrated form of neural networks which does not require any tuning<br>
Fascinating as it sounds ELMs are the simplest but yet powerful form of Single Layer Feed Forward Network<br>
Weights from the input to hidden layer are taken from Random Gaussian Noise. <br>Hidden to Output layer weights are calculated using
simple calculus methods such as Moore-Penrose Inverse.<br>
ELMs offer fast training times and great generalization capacities.<br>
It's interesting to further explore ELMs further by combining their power with Recurrent Neural Networks.<br>

### Gray Correlation Degree(GCD)
Gray Correlation Analysis is coded which uses geometric shape of two sequence curves to present relational degree between two data sequence.<br>

### Oscillation Box Theory and Trading Strategy
Oscillation Box Theory is used in Stock Market Trading.<br>
It defines a shock range for stock movements(Upper, Lower boundaries)<br>
Buy Indicator: When a stock breaks upper shock range OR stock is closer to lower shock range<br>
Sell Indicator: When a stock breaks lower shock range OR stock is closer to upper shock range<br>
Trading strategy is built and tested on AAPL stock ticker which showed 17.61% rate of profit on average.
